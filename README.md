# Shopping Information Using MYSQL
## Project Description
Created and managed databases and tables to store shopping-related data. Utilized DDL, DML, and DQL commands to define structure, manipulate, and query data. Analyzed datasets using GROUP BY, subqueries, and aggregate functions. Compared data across two databases using JOIN, INNER JOIN, and UNION ALL. Implemented core operations with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and used transaction control commands like COMMIT and ROLLBACK for data consistency.
